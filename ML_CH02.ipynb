    "\n",
    "Now that the data is loaded into the notebook we can start to explore the underlying data and learn as much about the data types and structure. We should be keeping in mind a couple thing about the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Size of the data\n",
    "\n",
    "Is the dataset we are using large enough to develop a machine learning algorithm that applies to the real world? If the dataset is too smal we risk only fitting the model to a small subset of information without truly representing the population data.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if the dataset is too large, we need to start worrying about the ability of the machine we are devleoping on to be able to process the amount of data, and we could potentially need to start working in the Data Engineering space to distribute our data over severaly nodes in a cluster. Don't worry if this doesn't make sense to you right now, as I will focus on Data Engineering in detail in other posts. If you are interested now in distributed computing with python, you can research [Dask](https://dask.org/) or [Spark (PySpark)](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/index.html) in order to get a better understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Quality of the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Is the data from a reputable & authoratative data source and is it complete and accurate? This is one of the major issues everyone will run into when doing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), even at major companies with mature data pipelines. It is best to make sure the data passes a \"sniff\" test. For example, if there is a date field, are there only dates in it? Does a population field only have Integers? Keep these questions in mind when exploring the datasets. A quick way to check a couple records is by using the ```.head()``` function in python to view the top couple of records."
